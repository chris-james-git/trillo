Flexbox showcase, based on the excellent online course delivered by Jonas Schmedtmann: https://www.udemy.com/advanced-css-and-sass/

I have published the finished showcase project here: https://chrisjamesdev.000webhostapp.com/trillo/

This project explores the power of "flexbox" - the CSS Flexible Box Layout Module. The flexbox module gives us a method of easily positioning elements in horizontal or vertical stacks in a way that is much easier than using older systems such as the float / clearfix approach.

Flexbox has been supported by most browsers now for several years and is in common usage. See: https://caniuse.com/#feat=flexbox
